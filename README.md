# 📊 Create Data Warehouse Project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a modern data warehouse from scratch using dimensional modeling techniques.  
It encompasses data ingestion, transformation, and modeling to facilitate efficient analytical querying and reporting.

## 🧱 Project Architecture

The data warehouse is structured following the **Medallion Architecture**, comprising three layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from source systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) into the staging area.
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, standardization, and transformation processes to prepare data for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.
